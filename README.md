# Bioinformatics Bootcamp Special Topics Workshop: **Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis**
*Presented by UT Health San Antonio BIG Club*

Welcome to the Bioinformatics Bootcamp Advanced topics workshop on **Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis**. This workshop is designed to teach you how to:
- Perform basic scRNA-Seq data preparation.
- Use manifold learning techniques to analyze cellular relationships in scRNA-Seq data.
- Find and interpret biologically-meaningful patterns in scRNA-Seq data.
- Integrate single cell data from multiple batches, studies, or modalities. 
- Present the results of scRNA-Seq analyses with publication-quality figures.

The workshop is broken up into several interactive modules:
1. Introduction to single cell biology and loading single cell datasets
2. Single cell data preparation
3. Manifold learning with single cell datasets
4. Biological interpretation of single cell RNA-Seq
5. Data integration, cell cycle, and other advanced topics in scRNA-Seq analysis
6. Final Project: Identification of clinically-relevant tumor subpopulations

Navigate to the folder for each module to view the relevant scripts, assignments, and lecture materials.
